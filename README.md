# Odin's-Binary-Search-Trees

This project implements a functional Binary Search Tree in pure JavaScript.
The tree is built from a sorted, duplicate‑free array and remains balanced by default. 
It supports all core BST operations: Insertion, Deletion, Search, as well as traversal methods (Level‑order, Inorder, Preorder, Postorder), each with optional callbacks. 

Additional utilities include computing node height and depth, checking whether the tree is balanced, and rebuilding it into a balanced form. 

A prettyPrint helper is included for visualizing the structure, and the driver script demonstrates the full workflow: building a tree, verifying balance, unbalancing it through inserts, and restoring balance with rebalance().
